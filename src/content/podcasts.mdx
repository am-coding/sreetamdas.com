Here's the podcasts that I listen to, in a rough order of preference:

## [Syntax](https://syntax.fm)

I learnt React from Wes Bos' courses and he carries forward the same quality into this endeavour of his with Scott Tolinski as well. I love staying up-to-date with the latest in webdev and there's no better way than this. Plus, amazing sick-picks!

## [The Joe Rogan Experience](http://podcasts.joerogan.net)

This is one of those where you just leave your brain behind and listen. There's a 50/50 chance you get scarred for life or you encounter a genuinely good episode (the one with Bernie Sanders!)
