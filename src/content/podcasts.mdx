Here's the podcasts that I listen to, in a rough order of preference:

## [Syntax](https://syntax.fm)

This is the first developer podcast I laid my hands on and I really enjoy the way Wes Bos teaches things, I listen to this podcast the most to keep myself updated about the web development world.

## [The Joe Rogan Experience](http://podcasts.joerogan.net)

This is the most diverse podcast in my opinion which has a lot to teach you about various things in life, my favorite episodes include the one with Brian Greene and Brian Cox (Like I said, I am a space enthusiast.)
