## Hey there!

My name is Amrik Malhans and I'm a Fullstack Engineer (more focused towards backend development) at [Cloutwallet](https://app.cloutwallet.io).

I'm a self-taught developer with a passion for computer science and programming. I've been fascinated by computers and their nitty gritty details about how they work since an early age, I got my first computer at an early age of 15 and I've been coding ever since then.
In the past, I started with HTML5 & CSS and learned JavaScript and I've worked extensively in the Web Development space as a freelancer and a contract developer. Currently I am most interested in working with the stack of React, TypeScript, GraphQL and Go.

Apart from programming, I am also a constant reader and I read a lot of non-fiction books with philosophy being my current favorite genre. I also play sports and was in my school's team as a lead soccer player, I also have a deep interest in Cosmos and Astrophysics and I am always looking for new information to consume on that topic.

You can check me out on the following platforms:
